# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Bug Fixes

- Respect lexical parameter shadowing in declaration navigation and hover, including shadowed module qualifiers and scoped parameter annotations.
- Reject unsupported module-alias rename instead of renaming an imported member under a different cursor.
- Preserve body indentation after colonless declarations during newline formatting; handle comments, quoted delimiters, and incomplete literals safely.
- Retain watched closed-file updates across concurrent document commits and preserve newer open-buffer import edges until close.
- Wait for relevant imported-document revisions in cross-file queries without blocking unrelated documents during cold snapshot construction.
- Update revision readiness atomically so older completion or cancellation cannot overwrite a newer pending revision.
- Kill and reap active compiler-check and `bend base` children before shutdown or process exit completes; preserve configured compiler arguments, buffered responses at stdin EOF, and staging resources until child cleanup finishes.

### CI

- Add report-only Callgrind calibration with independent A/A builds, layout and positive-regression controls, preserved raw evidence, and discovery-only proposals checked against independent validation; active gates remain unchanged.
